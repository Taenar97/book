**NordicQuantum** is a group of young and motivated students hailing from the **[University of Applied Sciences Kiel (UAS Kiel)](https://www.fh-kiel.de/startseite/)** in northern Germany.  
Currently we are a student research group at the data science departement of the UAS located at the **[StartUp-Office @ UAS Kiel](https://www.fh-kiel.de/studium/studierende/career-center/startup-office/)**.  
Our origins are quite diversified: Economics, Data Science, Computer Science and even Craftsmanship.  
<br>
Our interest in the deep tech field of **Quantum Computing** sprung from an interdisciplinary course organised by *[Tjark Ziehm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjarkziehm/)* in late 2021.  
How he as a learned craftsman developed a passion for quantum is subject to his own portrait in the next node **'The Team'**.
